\section*{Summary}

PhD candidate at UCLA specializing in AI and neuroscience.  

I develop foundation models for EEG and invasive neural data to improve diagnosis, prediction, and brainâ€“computer interfaces in neurological disorders. Previously collaborated with the Brain AI team at FAIR on large-scale brain foundation models. I'm especially excited about using non-invasive neural recording to improve our understanding of the brain and enhance clinical outcomes.
